This is my website page for the week 2 lab assignment of web programming course. Web programming is one of my favourite courses that I like to learn for project development. On this page, I will describe about myself in a short introduction on my favourite places, pictures and my computing skills.<br><br>Short introduction to myself, I am a person who interested in technologies and sports. Passionate on studying about programming to enhance my computing skills. I would like to explore more about programming language and software skills.<br><br>Since I was studying in UKM, I have been involved in many organization programs and sports. I have started learning about programming during in UKM. I have no basic knowledge about programming until I am studying in UKM. I have learnt so much knowledge and improved my soft skills since now. That's all from me, hopefully we could meet in person. Thank you for your time.
